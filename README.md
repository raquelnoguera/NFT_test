# NFT Test

This project implements a solidity contract for NFTs and provides a fully decentralised front-end 
to mint NFTs and to transact them.

Storage for the NFT is done in the IPFS or Storj DCS.

In this project I use:

* the (hardhat)[https://hardhat.org/] framework for development and testing of the contract.
* the vue.js (quasar)[https://quasar.dev/] framework for development of the frontend.
